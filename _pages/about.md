I’m **Shashank Pratap Singh**, a PhD Candidate in mathematics at the University of Iowa working in representation theory, Hopf algebras,
and finite tensor categories under the guidance of Prof. [Ryan Kinser](https://homepage.math.uiowa.edu/~rkinser/).

Right now I’m especially interested in:

- Taft algebras and their module categories
- Finite tensor categories and internal algebraic structures
- Categorical approaches to representation theory
